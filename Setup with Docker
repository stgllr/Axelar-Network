JOINING THE AXELAR TESTNET
Clone the repository to use the scripts and configs

git clone https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community.git
cd axelarate-community

Checkout the correct tag so the scripts work with the deployment.
git checkout <release-tag>

Run the script 
join/joinTestnet.sh

You can get the latest version and save it to variables:
CORE_VERSION=$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community/main/documentation/docs/testnet-releases.md  | grep axelar-core | cut -d \` -f 4)
echo ${CORE_VERSION}

Wait for your node to catch up with the network before proceeding. Use docker logs -f axelar-core to keep an eye on the node's progress (this can take a while).
You can check the sync status by running:

curl localhost:26657/status | jq '.result.sync_info'
Wait for catching_up to become false
